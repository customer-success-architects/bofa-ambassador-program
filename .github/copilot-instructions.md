# General
When refactoring for a decrease in Cognitive Complexity, remove unnecessary logic. For example: adding to a task's score because of the description of a task. That is unneeded.

# Python
Always write my Python unit tests using `pytest`, not `unittest`.

# .NET
When suggesting .NET code, only suggest code compatible with .NET 8.
Always write my .NET unit tests using `Xunit`.
